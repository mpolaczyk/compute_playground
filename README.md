# computePlayground

Author: [planet620]

The idea behind this repository is to:

- Gather performance focused code snippets

- Compare computing techniques

Projects:

- areaBenchmark - inspired by [Clean" Code, Horrible Performance]. Shows how Naive OOP solution differs in performance from vectorized or multithreaded processing.

### Dependencies

- Concurrent code uses Concurrency Visualizer
	- [Concurrency Visualizer SDK]
	- Extensions -> Add Concurrency Visualizer -> Restart VS and install -> Analyze -> Concurrency Visualizer -> Add SDK to project
- Performance measurement is done with [Google Benchmark]
