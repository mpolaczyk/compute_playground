The idea behind this repository is to gather:
- Performance focused code snippets

### Dependencies

- Concurrent code uses Concurrency Visualizer
	- [Concurrency Visualizer SDK]
	- Extensions -> Add Concurrency Visualizer -> Restart VS and install -> Analyze -> Concurrency Visualizer -> Add SDK to project
- Performance measurement is done with [Google Benchmark]
